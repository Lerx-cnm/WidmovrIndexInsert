# WidmoVR Index Insert 3D Model

## About the Model

- **Original Creator:** WidmoVR
- **Repository Purpose:** This repository hosts a 3D model that is the property of WidmoVR. It has been uploaded for the purpose of providing access to the original model.

## Model Description

This 3D model is not designed as a camera mount for ETVR. Instead, it is intended to assist anyone in the future who may wish to model accessories or modifications related to the WidmoVR Index mount.
The two extrusions on the side of the model (flat and curved) are to account for the lettering, which I have not fully modelled yet. They are basically nothing, but might cause problems with tight tolerances. 
I did not model the glass inside the insert, as it would change person to person and is out of the way. 

Again, this model is NOT a mount for ETVR cameras and v4 boards (or below). But purely as access to the Index WidmoVR Insert in case anyone in the future wants to model 'Something' around it, as WidmoVR was unable to give me a 3d model themselves.
